# Frame Effects and Political Engineering Analysis of the Press

### Hypothesis
1. Even if the same incident is reported, the perspective of people is different depending on the tone or nuance of the title of the article, so the bias effect will occur and affect the degree of change in the approval rating.
2. The degree of interest that a particular media has in a politician will affect the approval rating of a politician.

### Goal

1. Crawling by media company classifies articles by timing as positive/negative by incorporating them into existing 'Emotional Word Dictionary' data
2. Analysis of the correlation between politician's approval rating, frequency of articles, and tone
3. Learning to sense the tone of the sentence in (1) through **Deep Learning**
4. Predict the **approval rating in advance** based on the content of this month's article through correlation learning
